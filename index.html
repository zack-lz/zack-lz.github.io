            <h1><center><b>The History and Future of Quantum Computing</b><br>ZACK</center></h1>
            <p><h2>Introduction</h2>Quantum computing is a type of computational device that operates based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Its emergence has the potential to disrupt our current understanding of computing power. Unlike classical computers, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) to perform calculations. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition), allowing for parallel computations. As technology advances, quantum computing has evolved from theoretical concepts to practical reality, becoming a leading research frontier in computation and bringing limitless application potential. This report will explore the history, core principles, and prospects of quantum computing.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a href="https://quantumpedia.uk/a-brief-history-of-quantum-computing-e0bbd05893d0">I. The History of Quantum Computing</a></h2>
    
            <p>1. Early Theories<br>The history of quantum computing can be traced back to the early 20th century with the development of quantum mechanics. Physicists like Max Planck and Albert Einstein introduced the quantum theory, explaining the behaviour of particles and their interactions at the subatomic level. These theories laid the foundation for the later development of quantum computing.</p>
    <p>2. Richard Feynman and the Proposal of Quantum Computing
       <br> <img src="https://pm1.narvii.com/6558/6a9eec9ff69e799e011f935420b4567e7543700c_hq.jpg" alt="示例图片" width="235" height="310">
        <br>The concept of quantum computing was formally proposed by American physicist Richard Feynman. In 1981, during a lecture, Feynman pointed out that classical computers are highly inefficient when simulating quantum systems. Thus he suggested designing computers based on quantum mechanics to handle such complex computational tasks. Feynman's idea became the starting point for quantum computing research.</p>
    <p>3. Peter Shor and Quantum Algorithms<br>In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor introduced a quantum algorithm known as "Shor's algorithm." This algorithm allows quantum computers to greatly accelerate the process of integer factorization, which is the basis of modern encryption systems. The proposal of Shor's algorithm marked the first step in taking quantum computing from theory to practical application.</p>

    <button id="nextButton"><h4>Next: Video Page</h4></button>
    <br><p>1. Quantum Bits (Qubits)<br>Unlike classical computers, where bits can only be in a state of 0 or 1, the basic unit of a quantum computer is a quantum bit (qubit), which can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1. In other words, qubits can represent multiple states simultaneously, enabling quantum computers to process various tasks in parallel, greatly enhancing computational efficiency.</p>
    <p>2. Quantum Superposition and Quantum Entanglement<br>- Quantum Superposition: Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon known as quantum superposition. Superposition enables quantum computers to perform parallel processing that far exceeds the capabilities of classical computers.<br>- Quantum Entanglement: When multiple qubits become entangled, their states are tightly correlated, meaning that the measurement of one qubit’s state immediately affects the other, even if they are far apart. Quantum entanglement allows for more efficient information transmission.</p>
    <p>3. Quantum vs. Classical Computing
        <br> <img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2YQErq7Y9uPEX-GO_JpG3wq4Z5ZkR6MbahG_4DCWUKqkamtQR-m9vSrmF09seZzZ3GZg3osbOnIJCU2IBe6cHSnlcWNhMEGUO8JHoE4KwvHYDSH3NHyJ_ewKFQWTvDXp6skJGpjO43HbA3QTll1AZQqu7bcXDg_BbIpgJ2a2yrkg2VpJhC4M_ar6EhUI/s16000/quantum%20computing%20vs%20classical%20computing.jpg" alt="示例图片" width="500" height="300">
        <br>Through superposition and entanglement, quantum computers can solve problems that classical computers cannot complete within a reasonable time frame. Classical computers rely on sequentially processing information, whereas quantum computers can handle multiple data points simultaneously.For example, in tasks such as breaking encryption algorithms or simulating complex molecular structures, quantum computers offer far more potential than classical machines.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>III. Recent Research in Quantum Computing</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/technology/computing/google-and-nasa-achieve-quantum-supremacy/">1. Google's Quantum Supremacy</a><br>In 2019, Google announced that its quantum computer, Sycamore, had achieved "quantum supremacy," meaning that a quantum computer was able to complete a task that a classical computer could not solve within a reasonable time frame. In the experiment, Sycamore completed a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a classical computer 10,000 years. This breakthrough demonstrated quantum computing’s powerful ability to tackle certain specific problems.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Quantum_Platform">2. IBM's Quantum Computing Development</a>: IBM is another major player in the field of quantum computing. The company has launched the quantum computing service "IBM Quantum," which allows users to access quantum computing resources via the cloud. IBM is working on commercializing quantum computers, aiming to apply this technology to a wide range of fields such as finance, material science, and drug development.</p>
    <p>3. Future Potential and Challenges<br>- Encryption and Security: Quantum computers can break existing encryption systems, leading to the need for redesigned quantum-resistant algorithms to address future security threats.
        <br>- Drug Development and Material Science: Quantum computing can simulate complex molecular behaviour, helping scientists accelerate drug development and discover new materials.
        <br>- Technical Challenges: Despite its enormous potential, quantum computing faces many challenges, such as how to stabilize qubit states and reduce noise and quantum errors.
